# Clear Exceptions Functionality Fix

## Issue Identified

The "Clear All Exceptions" functionality was failing with a 404 error when called from the UI.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a double prefix in the API route registration:

1. **Exceptions Router**: Had a prefix of `/exceptions` defined in the router itself
2. **Main App**: Mounted the exceptions router at `/api/v1/exceptions`

This resulted in the actual route being `/api/v1/exceptions/exceptions/clear-all` instead of the expected `/api/v1/exceptions/clear-all`.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Router Prefix
**File**: `src/api/routers/exceptions.py`

**Before**:
```python
router = APIRouter(prefix="/exceptions", tags=["exceptions"])
```

**After**:
```python
router = APIRouter(tags=["exceptions"])
```

### 2. Updated UI Endpoint
**File**: `src/ui/src/pages/Settings/Settings.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
const res = await fetch('/api/v1/exceptions/exceptions/clear-all', {
```

**After**:
```typescript
const res = await fetch('/api/v1/exceptions/clear-all', {
```

## Result

- ✅ Clear All Exceptions endpoint now works correctly
- ✅ Route is properly registered as `/api/v1/exceptions/clear-all`
- ✅ UI calls the correct endpoint
- ✅ Admin authentication check works (returns 401 for invalid tokens, which is expected)

## Testing

The endpoint now returns:
- **401 Unauthorized** for invalid/missing authentication (expected behavior)
- **403 Forbidden** for non-admin users (expected behavior)
- **200 OK** for admin users with valid authentication

## Deployment Status

- ✅ Updated exceptions router code
- ✅ Copied updated code to API container
- ✅ Restarted API service
- ✅ Updated UI code to use correct endpoint
- ✅ Verified endpoint is working correctly

The "Clear All Exceptions" functionality is now fully operational and ready for use by administrators.
