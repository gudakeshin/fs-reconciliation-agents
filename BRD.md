**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** August 6, 2025

## 1\. Introduction and Purpose

This document outlines the business requirements for developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of an agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) application, leveraging the LangGraph framework, to automate and enhance bank reconciliation processes. The primary purpose of this application is to significantly reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and accelerate the resolution of common financial discrepancies (breaks) within banking operations. By transforming traditional, often manual and error-prone reconciliation methods into a proactive, intelligent system, the application aims to provide real-time financial visibility and strengthen compliance.

## 2\. Scope of the MVP

The MVP will focus on addressing the following five critical types of reconciliation breaks:

  * **Security ID Breaks:** Discrepancies arising from different security identifiers used by transacting parties.
  * **Fixed Income Coupon Payments:** Errors in calculating or applying fixed income coupon payments due to day count methods or other economic elements.
  * **Market Price Differences:** Variations in the recorded market price of securities across different systems.
  * **Trade Date vs. Settlement Date:** Mismatches due to different recording dates for trades and settlements.
  * **FX Rate Errors:** Discrepancies in foreign exchange rates applied by different parties.

The MVP will establish the core agentic architecture, including data ingestion, normalization, matching, exception identification, and a human-in-the-loop mechanism for these specific break types. Future phases will expand to cover additional break types, advanced analytics, and deeper integration capabilities.

## 3\. Business Goals and Objectives

The successful implementation of this MVP will achieve the following business goals:

  * **Increase Operational Efficiency:** Reduce the time and manual effort currently spent on reconciliation tasks, aiming for a significant reduction in manual effort (e.g., 70-80% for report preparation) and faster resolution of exceptions (e.g., 50% reduction in median time to resolution).
  * **Enhance Data Accuracy:** Minimize human errors and inconsistencies in financial records, targeting a substantial reduction in reconciliation errors (e.g., up to 98%).
  * **Improve Financial Visibility:** Provide more timely and accurate insights into the bank's financial position by enabling continuous reconciliation.
  * **Strengthen Risk Management and Compliance:** Facilitate early detection of discrepancies, potential fraud, and ensure robust audit trails for regulatory adherence.

To ensure portability, scalability, and ease of deployment for the agentic bank reconciliation application, Docker will be the chosen containerization platform. Docker Compose will be utilized to orchestrate the multi-container architecture, simplifying the development and production environments. The application will leverage the OpenAI API for its Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities.

### 7.1. Core Components to Containerize

The application will consist of several services, each running in its own Docker container:

  * **LangGraph Agent Service:** This will be the core of the application, housing the LangGraph workflow and its various nodes (Data Ingestion, Normalization, Matching, Exception Identification, Resolution, Reporting). It will be a Python-based application.
  * **API Service (Backend):** A lightweight API layer (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) that exposes endpoints for the UI to interact with the LangGraph agent. This service will handle requests from the UI, pass them to the LangGraph agent, and return results.
  * **User Interface (UI) Service:** A web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) serving the static or dynamic UI assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
  * **Database Service:** A persistent data store (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store reconciliation states, audit trails, user configurations, and historical data.

### 7.2. Dockerfile and Docker Compose Configuration

**Dockerfile for LangGraph Agent Service:**

  * **Base Image:** A Python-slim base image (e.g., `python:3.10-slim-buster`) for a lean environment.
  * **Dependencies:** Install all necessary Python packages, including `langgraph`, `langchain-openai`, `pydantic`, and any other libraries required for data processing, API interactions, and financial calculations.dockerfile
    # Example Dockerfile for LangGraph Agent Service
    FROM python:3.10-slim-buster
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY requirements.txt.
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
    COPY..
    CMD ["python", "main.py"] \# Or your main application entry point
    ```
    ```
  * **Environment Variables:** Ensure that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is securely passed as an environment variable to this container. This should not be hardcoded in the Dockerfile.

**Dockerfile for API Service:**

  * Similar to the LangGraph Agent Service, using a Python base image and installing relevant web framework dependencies.

**Dockerfile for UI Service:**

  * A lightweight web server image (e.g., `nginx:alpine`) to serve the front-end application.

**Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`):**

  * Orchestrates the build and runtime of all services.
  * Defines network connectivity between services (e.g., UI connects to API, API connects to LangGraph Agent and Database).
  * Manages persistent volumes for the database to ensure data is not lost when containers are stopped or removed.
  * Example snippet for `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'
    services:
      langgraph-agent:
        build:./langgraph-agent # Path to your LangGraph Dockerfile
        environment:
          - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY} # Securely pass API key
        #... other configurations (volumes, networks)
      api-service:
        build:./api-service # Path to your API Dockerfile
        ports:
          - "8000:8000" # Example port
        #... other configurations (depends_on, networks)
      ui-service:
        build:./ui-service # Path to your UI Dockerfile
        ports:
          - "80:80" # Serve UI on port 80
        #... other configurations (depends_on, networks)
      database:
        image: postgres:13 # Example database
        volumes:
          - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        environment:
          - POSTGRES_DB=reconciliation_db
          - POSTGRES_USER=user
          - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
        #... other configurations (networks)
    volumes:
      db_data:
    ```

### 7.3. Deployment Considerations
